# Fiery Swarm

## About The Project

A Computer Science senior design project at California State University Fullerton.
  
Fiery Swarm explores the possibilities of swarm robotics. Weâ€™ve created an interconnected, distributed miniature vehicle platform designed to work in synchronicity with direct clones to perform autonomously-choreographed intelligent traversal. We aim to discover and explore ways in which to automate, iterate and continuously improve self-driving vehicle platforms with a centralized intelligence.
  
Our vehicle hardware platform consists of an ESP32 microcontroller mounted onto a modified low-cost remote cotrolled toy vehicle
 
Our software stack includes Arduino build tools, the FreeRTOS operating system and a selection of products from Amazon Web Services.
