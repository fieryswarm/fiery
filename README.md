# Fiery Swarm

  A Computer Science senior design project at California State University Fullerton.
  
  Fiery Swarm explores the possibilities of swarm robotics. Weâ€™ve created an interconnected, distributed miniature vehicle 
  platform designed to work in synchronicity with direct clones to perform autonomously-choreographed intelligent traversal. 
  We aim to discover and explore ways in which to automate, iterate and continuously improve self-driving vehicle platforms 
  with a centralized intelligence.
  
  Our vehicle hardware platform consists of an ESP32 microcontroller mounted onto a modified low-cost remote cotrolled toy 
  vehicle
 
  Our software stack includes Arduino build tools, the FreeRTOS operating system and a selection of products from Amazon Web 
  Services.

## Installing Arduino IDE & Connecting To ESP32:

## Setup:

- `pip install pyserial`

- `pip install esptool`

## Thing #'s:

- Tim: `0`
- David: `1`

## Common Problems & Solutions:

1) Ensure Arduino IDE connected to correct port; e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0

2) Ensure Arduino IDE is using correct profile; e.g. ESP32vn IoT Uno

3) Trouble writing to the device?
`sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0`
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
4) make menuconfig fails:
sudo apt install flex
sudo apt install bison
